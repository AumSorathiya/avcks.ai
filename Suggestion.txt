After you do Voice and Auido Module, there is no way to deactivate it. 
When you biometric identifucation, it opens bing but not for the entire pop up just 1/6 of the screen.
It says it will remeber the prompt you inputed, but when you ask there is no response
When I say check weather it repeats, the same output that it say when you input "Train a new command"
Also the terminal out, is the spaced out when the system responds. If you are trying to mimick a terminal put a "_"
The command "Increase system activity visuals" does the same thing as the command "Tell me about the system health."
The command "Mute audio" doesn't not mute the audio but instead pulls out a pop up 
Not sure about the other related commands to Mute audio because I can't check them without the command "Mute audio"
The command "Clear run data" clear the terminal out data. 


I don't if this AI terminal runs manually from a google spreadsheet or it builds on itself so if some of this command. 
It could be either Google Sheets as a “Fake Brain”, Keyword + Rule-Based Engine, Hidden Third-Party API (LLM, but Not Local), Local Storage / IndexedDB as “Memory” 
If it is so than you might want to ask any AI platform for a comprehensive list of standard command-prompt capabilities(or any other specific ones you are looking for), then use that list to program AVCKS to support those functions through voice interaction.


Changes to add: 
Add a scroll view to the terminal output.
Improve user-friendliness by letting users resize the terminal output.
AR rings could change based on commands a user enters.
When the website first opens, it asks for the user’s location; if the user allows it, you could display their weather on the interface when they input that specific command. btw it displays it on the interface. 
As a user, just staring at the webpage feels a bit boring, so add more animation to the text, more color variation, and possibly a richer background to make it feel more futuristic, which matches the vibe you’re already creating with the font and color choices.

Functions to add: 
Add command history and replay so users can scroll through and re-run previous commands.
Add auto-complete and command suggestions to predict what users are typing or saying.
Add user profiles to save preferences like theme, voice, and permissions.
Add command shortcuts or macros so multiple actions can be triggered with one command.
Add dynamic theme switching so colors, HUD styles, or modes can change via commands.
Add attention and focus mode to dim background visuals and highlight critical outputs.
Add live data widgets for time, date, weather, or system metrics.
Add error explanation mode so the AI explains failures in plain language.
Add conversation export so session logs can be downloaded or copied.
Add onboarding or guided tour to give first-time users an interactive walkthrough.
Add context locking to temporarily focus the AI on a specific topic or task.
Add ambient mode with idle animations, subtle sounds, and rotating intel when the system is unused.
Add command confidence feedback to show how certain the system is about its responses.
Add accessibility controls for voice speed, font size, contrast, and motion reduction.
Add an offline mode indicator to clearly show when the system is running fully local.

You can also add a AI agent to explain your webpage in simplier terms for new or users that don't really know what they are doing. plus its fun to abuse a AI agent. I know that chatgpt offers a free API I think that you can input into your webpage.
